@article{mcpherson2001,
  abstract = {Similarity breeds connection. This principle—the homophily principle—structures network ties of every type, including marriage, friendship, work, advice, support, information transfer, exchange, comembership, and other types of relationship. The result is that people's personal networks are homogeneous with regard to many sociodemographic, behavioral, and intrapersonal characteristics. Homophily limits people's social worlds in a way that has powerful implications for the information they receive, the attitudes they form, and the interactions they experience. Homophily in race and ethnicity creates the strongest divides in our personal environments, with age, religion, education, occupation, and gender following in roughly that order. Geographic propinquity, families, organizations, and isomorphic positions in social systems all create contexts in which homophilous relations form. Ties between nonsimilar individuals also dissolve at a higher rate, which sets the stage for the formation of niches (localized positions) within social space. We argue for more research on: (a) the basic ecological processes that link organizations, associations, cultural communities, social movements, and many other social forms; (b) the impact of multiplex ties on the patterns of homophily; and (c) the dynamics of network change over time through which networks and other social entities co-evolve.},

@book{salton1983,
abstract = {The skeletal muscles and axial skeleton of vertebrates derive from the embryonic paraxial mesoderm. In amniotes, paraxial mesoderm is formed bilaterally to the nerve cord as a result of primitive streak and tail-bud regression during body axis formation. In chick and mouse embryos, paraxial mesoderm was proposed to derive from a population of resident cells located in the regressing primitive streak and tail bud. In contrast, in lower vertebrates, paraxial mesoderm is formed as a result of the continuation of ingression movements of gastrulation. Here, we reinvestigate paraxial mesoderm formation in the chicken embryo and demonstrate that these two modes are concomitantly at work to set up the paraxial mesoderm. Although the medial part of somites derives from stem cells resident in the primitive streak/tail bud, the lateral part derives from continuous ingression of epiblastic material. Our fate mapping further shows that the paraxial mesoderm territory in the epiblast is regionalized along the anteroposterior axis as in lower vertebrates. These observations suggest that the mechanisms responsible for paraxial mesoderm formation are largely conserved across vertebrates.},

abstract = {We perform sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of missing data on the structural properties of social networks. The social network is conceived of as being generated by a bipartite graph, in which actors are linked together via multiple interaction contexts or affiliations. We discuss three principal missing data mechanisms: network boundary specification (non-inclusion of actors or affiliations), survey non-response, and censoring by vertex degree (fixed choice design), examining their impact on the scientific collaboration network from the Los Alamos E-print Archive as well as random bipartite graphs. The simulation results show that network boundary specification and fixed choice designs can dramatically alter estimates of network-level statistics. The observed clustering and assortativity coefficients are overestimated via omission of affiliations or fixed choice thereof, and underestimated via actor non-response, which results in inflated measurement error. We also find that social networks with multiple interaction contexts may have certain interesting properties due to the presence of overlapping cliques. In particular, assortativity by degree does not necessarily improve network robustness to random omission of nodes as predicted by current theory. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Methods of computing this index differ primarily in the way the upslope contributing area is calculated. In this study we compared a number of calculation methods for TWI and evaluated them in terms of their correlation with the following measured variables: vascular plant species richness, soil pH, groundwater level, soil moisture, and a constructed wetness degree. The TWI was calculated by varying six parameters affecting the distribution of accumulated area among downslope cells and by varying the way the slope was calculated. All possible combinations of these parameters were calculated for two separate boreal forest sites in northern Sweden. We did not find a calculation method that performed best for all measured variables; rather the best methods seemed to be variable and site specific. However, we were able to identify some general characteristics of the best methods for different groups of measured variables. The results provide guiding principles for choosing the best method for estimating species richness, soil pH, groundwater level, and soil moisture by the TWI derived from digital elevation models.},

large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law
distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected.
A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary
scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

In this paper, we present a local path index to estimate the likelihood of the existence of a link between two nodes. We propose a network model with controllable density and noise strength in generating links, as well as collect data of six real networks. Extensive numerical simulations on both modeled networks and real networks demonstrated the high effectiveness and efficiency of the local path index compared with two well-known and widely used indices: the common neighbors and the Katz index. Indeed, the local path index provides competitively accurate predictions as the Katz index while requires much less CPU time and memory space than the Katz index, which is therefore a strong candidate for potential practical applications in data mining of huge-size networks.},

@article{fouss2007,
abstract = {This work presents a new perspective on characterizing the similarity between elements of a database or, more generally, nodes of a weighted and undirected graph. It is based on a Markov-chain model of random walk through the database. More precisely, we compute quantities (the average commute time, the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix of the graph, etc.) that provide similarities between any pair of nodes, having the nice property of increasing when the number of paths connecting those elements increases and when the "length" of paths decreases. It turns out that the square root of the average commute time is a Euclidean distance and that the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix is a kernel matrix (its elements are inner products closely related to commute times). A principal component analysis (PCA) of the graph is introduced for computing the subspace projection of the node vectors in a manner that preserves as much variance as possible in terms of the Euclidean commute-time distance. This graph PCA provides a nice interpretation to the "Fiedler vector," widely used for graph partitioning. The model is evaluated on a collaborative-recommendation task where suggestions are made about which movies people should watch based upon what they watched in the past. Experimental results on the MovieLens database show that the Laplacian-based similarities perform well in comparison with other methods. The model, which nicely fits into the so-called "statistical relational learning" framework, could also be used to compute document or word similarities, and, more generally, it could be applied to machine-learning and pattern-recognition tasks involving a relational database},

abstract = {How closely related are two nodes in a graph? How to compute this score quickly, on huge, disk-resident, real graphs? Random walk with restart (RWR) provides a good relevance score between two nodes in a weighted graph, and it has been successfully used in numerous settings, like automatic captioning of images, generalizations to the "connection subgraphs", personalized PageRank, and many more. However, the straightforward implementations of RWR do not scale for large graphs, requiring either quadratic space and cubic pre-computation time, or slow response time on queries. We propose fast solutions to this problem. The heart of our approach is to exploit two important properties shared by many real graphs: (a) linear correlations and (b) block- wise, community-like structure. We exploit the linearity by using low-rank matrix approximation, and the community structure by graph partitioning, followed by the Sherman- Morrison lemma for matrix inversion. Experimental results on the Corel image and the DBLP dabasets demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve significant savings over the straightforward implementations: they can save several orders of magnitude in pre-computation and storage cost, and they achieve up to 150x speed up with 90\%+ quality preservation.},

We pro- pose a complementary approach, applicable in any domain with object-to-object relationships, that measures similar- ity of the structural context in which objects occur, based on their relationships with other objects. Effectively, we compute a measure that says “two objects are similar if they are related to similar objects.” This general similar- ity measure, called SimRank, is based on a simple and in- tuitive graph-theoretic model. For a given domain, Sim- Rank can be combined with other domain-specific simi- larity measures. We suggest techniques for efficient com- putation of SimRank scores, and provide experimental re- sults on two application domains showing the computa- tional feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract = {Question-Answering Bulletin Boards (QABB), such as Yahoo! Answers and Windows Live QnA, are gaining popularity recently. Questions are submitted on QABB and let somebody in the internet answer them. Communications on QABB connect users, and the overall connections can be regarded as a social network. If the evolution of social networks can be predicted, it is quite useful for encouraging communications among users. Link prediction on QABB can be used for recommendation to potential answerers. Previous approaches for link prediction based on structural properties do not take weights of links into account. This paper describes an improved method for predicting links based on weighted proximity measures of social networks. The method is based on an assumption that proximities between nodes can be estimated better by using both graph proximity measures and the weights of existing links in a social network. In order to show the effectiveness of our method, the data of Yahoo! Chiebukuro (Japanese Yahoo! Answers) are used for our experiments. The results show that our method outperforms previous approaches, especially when target social networks are sufficiently dense.},

abstract = {A social network is composed by communities of individuals or organizations that are connected by a common interest. Online social networking sites like Twitter, Facebook and Orkut are among the most visited sites in the Internet. Presently, there is a great interest in trying to understand the complexities of this type of network from both theoretical and applied point of view. The understanding of these social network graphs is important to improve the current social network systems, and also to develop new applications. Here, we propose a friend recommendation system for social network based on the topology of the network graphs. The topology of network that connects a user to his friends is examined and a local social network called Oro-Aro is used in the experiments. We developed an algorithm that analyses the sub-graph composed by a user and all the others connected people separately by three degree of separation. However, only users separated by two degree of separation are candidates to be suggested as a friend. The algorithm uses the patterns defined by their connections to find those users who have similar behavior as the root user. The recommendation mechanism was developed based on the characterization and analyses of the network formed by the user's friends and friends-of-friends (FOF).},

In many applications, notably in genetics, a partially observed network may not contain any negative examples of absent edges, which creates a difficulty for many existing supervised learning approaches. We develop a new method which treats the observed network as a sample of the true network with different sampling rates for positive and negative examples. We obtain a relative ranking of potential links by their probabilities, utilizing information on node covariates as well as on network topology. Empirically, the method performs well under many settings, including when the observed network is sparse. We apply the method to a protein-protein interaction network and a school friendship network.},

abstract = {In many complex social systems, the timing and frequency of interactions between individuals are observable but friendship ties are hidden. Recovering these hidden ties, particularly for casual users who are relatively less active, would enable a wide variety of friendship-aware applications in domains where labeled data are often unavailable, including online advertising and national security. Here, we investigate the accuracy of multiple statistical features, based either purely on temporal interaction patterns or on the cooperative nature of the interactions, for automatically extracting latent social ties. Using self-reported friendship and non-friendship labels derived from an anonymous online survey, we learn highly accurate predictors for recovering hidden friendships within a massive online data set encompassing 18 billion interactions among 17 million individuals of the popular online game Halo: Reach. We find that the accuracy of many features improves as more data accumulates, and cooperative features are generally reliable. However, periodicities in interaction time series are sufficient to correctly classify 95\% of ties, even for casual users. These results clarify the nature of friendship in online social environments and suggest new opportunities and new privacy concerns for friendship-aware applications that do not require the disclosure of private friendship information.},

abstract = {The problem of identifying cohesive subgroups in social hypertext is reviewed. A computationally efficient three-step framework for identifying cohesive subgroups is proposed, referred to as the Social Cohesion Analysis of Networks (SCAN) method. In the first step of this method (Select), people within a social network are screened using a level of network centrality to select possible subgroup members. In the second step (Collect), the people selected in the first step are collected into subgroups identified at each point in time using hierarchical cluster analysis. In the third step (Choose), similarity modeling is used to choose cohesive subgroups based on the similarity of subgroups when compared across different points in time. The application of this SCAN method is then demonstrated in a case study where a subgroup is automatically extracted from a social network formed based on the online interactions of a group of about 150 people that occurred over a two-year period. In addition, this paper also demonstrates that similarity-based cohesion can provide a different, and in this case more compelling, subgroup representation than a method based on splitting a hierarchical clustering dendrogram using an optimality criterion.},

abstract = {The automated analysis of social networks has become an important problem due to the proliferation of social networks, such as LiveJournal, Flickr and Facebook. The scale of these social networks is massive and continues to grow rapidly. An important problem in social network analysis is proximity estimation that infers the closeness of different users. Link prediction, in turn, is an important application of proximity estimation. However, many methods for computing proximity measures have high computational complexity and are thus prohibitive for large-scale link prediction problems. One way to address this problem is to estimate proximity measures via low-rank approximation. However, a single low-rank approximation may not be sufficient to represent the behavior of the entire network. In this paper, we propose Multi-Scale Link Prediction (MSLP), a framework for link prediction, which can handle massive networks. The basic idea of MSLP is to construct low-rank approximations of the network at multiple scales in an efficient manner. To achieve this, we propose a fast tree-structured approximation algorithm. Based on this approach, MSLP combines predictions at multiple scales to make robust and accurate predictions. Experimental results on real-life datasets with more than a million nodes show the superior performance and scalability of our method. © 2012 ACM.},

The present study aims to propose two new similarity indices, based on granular computing approach and fuzzy logic. It also presents a new hybrid model for creating synergy between various link prediction models. Results show that fuzzy system analysis, in comparison with the crisp approach, can make more effective predictions through better expression of network characteristics. The indices are tested on collaboration networks. It is found that the accuracy of predictions is significantly higher than the crisp approach. It can modify the models for computing the strength of the links and/or predicting the evolutions of the social networks. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators, Josephson junction arrays, excitable media, neural networks, spatial games, genetic control networks and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},
